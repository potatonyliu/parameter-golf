First SSM-based entry in either track. Trained on 4×H200 SXM for one hour rather than 8×H100 for ten minutes — non-record on both hardware and time. Eval is the standard root-harness full-window val + int8/brotli quant; no TTT, no sliding-window, no GPTQ.

## Architecture

**Topology.** 7 distinct transformer-style blocks, each shared across 3 sequential applications via depth recurrence (`NUM_UNIQUE_LAYERS=7 NUM_LOOPS=3`). Effective compute depth is 21; total stored body parameters are equivalent to 7 layers. No U-Net skip; the loop is plain weight reuse. `MODEL_DIM=512`, tied input/output embeddings, sp1024 vocab.

**Block contents.** Each block is `(attn || SSM) + MLP`, not the standard `attn → MLP` chain:

1. RMSNorm → run attention and the SSM in parallel on the same normalized input → sum their outputs (with independent per-channel learned scales `attn_scale`, `s4d_scale`) into the residual stream.
2. RMSNorm → SwiGLU MLP (`MLP_MULT=8`, hidden = 8·dim) → add to the residual stream with its own per-channel scale (`mlp_scale`).
3. A learned 2-vector `resid_mix` per block interpolates the incoming residual between the live stream `x` and the original post-embedding `x0` before normalization. Cheap, lets each block decide how much it cares about deep context vs the original embedding.

**Attention branch.** Standard causal multi-head attention with grouped-query (`NUM_HEADS=8`, `NUM_KV_HEADS=4`) and RoPE positional encoding.

**SSM branch — kill-Mamba-2.** Standard Mamba-2 has an `in_proj` that produces `x` plus three input-dependent quantities `dt`, `B`, `C` ("selectivity" — the ability to modulate the recurrence per-token), runs a depthwise causal `conv1d` (kernel=4) on `x`, then an SSD chunkwise selective scan (`d_state=64`, `expand=2`, `chunk_size=64`, `headdim=64`, 16 SSD heads), then `out_proj`. **kill-Mamba-2 replaces `dt`, `B`, `C` with learned per-head/per-state constants** (`_B_const`, `_C_const`) and a per-head `dt_bias`, making the recurrence linear time-invariant (LTI) instead of input-dependent. Same conv1d, same gating, same `A_log`, same `D_skip`, same in/out projections — only the dynamics become LTI. The intuition: at sub-records training scale, the input-dependent projections are under-trained and add noise; the LTI variant keeps the structural advantages of Mamba-2 (conv1d local recall, gated SSD scan) without the gradient surface area of selectivity.

**Why parallel attention || SSM.** The two mixers have complementary recall: attention does exact content-addressable lookup over the context, conv1d-equipped SSM does structured local recall. Running them on the same normalized input and summing outputs is consistently better at this scale than alternating attention-only and SSM-only blocks (cross-class hybrid finding from earlier experiments).

**No BigramHash.** BigramHash recall (`BIGRAM_VOCAB_SIZE=0` here) helps S4D-Lin family blocks but interacts negatively with the conv1d already present in Mamba-2 — it ends up adding noise to the recall niche conv1d already occupies.

**Quantization (`TERNARY_BODY=1`).** Body weights of the attention `qkv`/`out` projections, Mamba-2 `in_proj`/`out_proj`, and SwiGLU MLP gates are constrained to `{−γ, 0, +γ}` ternary via BitNet-b1.58 absmean straight-through estimation: at every forward pass each weight matrix is quantized to ternary (with a per-row scale γ = mean absolute value) before the matmul; gradients pass through unchanged. Roughly 1.58 bits per parameter of effective resolution. At quant export, ternary weights are stored as 2 bits per parameter packed (4 vals per byte) in a custom format that bypasses int8 entirely — lossless ternary→ternary round-trip. 1D and small (≤65,536-element) tensors — the SSM dynamics buffers `A_log`, `B_proj`, `C_proj`, `dt_bias`, `D_skip`, `conv1d` weights, all RMSNorm scales, all per-channel scales — stay fp32 throughout via `CONTROL_TENSOR_NAME_PATTERNS`.

**EMA-of-weights (`EMA_BETA=0.999`).** A shadow copy of the model weights is updated each step as `shadow = β·shadow + (1−β)·model`, then swapped into the model at the last step before eval. β=0.999 gives an effective averaging window of ~1000 steps — about the last 23% of this run's 4,380 steps. EMA is reliable when `(1−β)·steps ≫ 1`; for shorter runs (<3,000 steps) β=0.99 is the right choice.

**Optimizer.** Muon (Newton-Schulz orthogonalization, `MUON_BACKEND_STEPS=15`) for 2D weight matrices; AdamW for low-dim parameters and embeddings. `MATRIX_LR=0.045` is the modded-nanogpt baseline value. The optimizer split is by tensor pattern, same as the records-track convention.

**Compression.** int8 quantization of fp32 buffers + 2-bit packed ternary for body weights → brotli q=11 → final artifact. brotli/zlib ratio on this bytestream is ~0.985; brotli is the standard records-track choice.
