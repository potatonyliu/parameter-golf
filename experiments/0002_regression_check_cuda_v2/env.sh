# WARMDOWN_ITERS >= ITERATIONS triggers the step-based warmdown from step 0,
# yielding an effective LR ramp of (1200 - step) / 1200 across the whole run
# (0.167 at step 0, ~0 by step 200). This is the regime the Apr-18 reference
# baseline ran in (ITERATIONS=200, WARMDOWN_ITERS unset → defaulted to 1200),
# and it's what our smoke needs: full canonical LR (warmdown_iters << iterations)
# is too aggressive for MPS bf16 numerics and NaNs around step 165.
# To run an experiment at full canonical LR, override per-experiment with a
# small WARMDOWN_ITERS plus an explicit LR_WARMUP_STEPS (10–20).
