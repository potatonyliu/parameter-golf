# baseline ran in (ITERATIONS=200, WARMDOWN_ITERS unset → defaulted to 1200),
# and it's what our smoke needs: full canonical LR (warmdown_iters << iterations)
# is too aggressive for MPS bf16 numerics and NaNs around step 165.

# small WARMDOWN_ITERS plus an explicit LR_WARMUP_STEPS (10–20).

# Tests whether the Mamba-2 win compounds vs the 1-of-3 sandwich (0032/0034).
# 0046: Cross-class hybrid topology. Pattern per K=3 group:
#   pos 0: kill-Mamba-2 (LTI)
#   pos 1: PARALLEL = ATTN || kill-Mamba-2 (sum outputs, scaled)
#   pos 2: kill-Mamba-2 (LTI)
# Tests whether 0027's middle-parallel surprise win compounds with 0038/42's
# kill-Mamba-2 win. Subagent code change: parallel block uses Mamba2Block
# (with kill_selectivity flag) instead of S4DLin in the parallel position.
# 0051: TRIPLE PARALLEL — all 3 unique blocks are PARALLEL (ATTN ||
# kill-Mamba-2). Tests if parallel-topology is universally good or if
# middle-only placement is special. Cap impact: each parallel block ~2.44
# MB; 3 × 2.44 = 7.32 MB SSM+attn (vs 0046's 5.74 MB) → predicted artifact

# - 0102 (SSM + ternary + LR×3 @ 2000 steps) — measures ternary penalty/gain on SSM at scale
# - 0101 (transformer alone @ 2000 steps) — measures SSM contribution at extended training
