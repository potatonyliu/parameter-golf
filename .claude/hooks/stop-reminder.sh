# Stop reminder — soft nudge for autoresearch sessions.
#
# Scope (all three gates must pass for the nudge to fire):
#   1. Branch matches `autoresearch-*`.
#   2. This session has done actual research work — at least one Edit/Write
#      under `experiments/NNNN_<slug>/`, OR a Bash invocation of
#      run_experiment.sh / await_steps.sh / new_experiment.sh. Read or `ls`
#      of experiments/ does NOT count: tooling sessions on the same branch
#      (like the one editing this hook) routinely inspect experiments
#      without doing research.
#   3. No training process is currently running (`python … train_gpt.py`).
#      The agent legitimately ends turns to await long background runs;
#      nudging mid-await would loop forever.
#
# Failure mode this guards against: an open-ended overnight loop on a
# non-research conversation on the same branch, where the hook keeps
# blocking stops and the agent keeps responding, burning tokens.
#
# Behavior on a passing session:
#   - Look at the most recent text content block across all assistant
#     messages in the transcript. If it contains SENTINEL → allow.
#     Otherwise → block with the reminder.
#
# Why "latest text content block" rather than "latest assistant message":
#   Claude Code splits a single agent turn into separate JSONL entries — one
#   for thinking, one for text, one per tool_use. They land at slightly
#   different timestamps. Filtering by "no tool_use" alone catches thinking
#   entries (which have no text), and the matcher can race with the writer
#   if the thinking line lands but the text line hasn't flushed yet. Working
#   directly off "latest text block ever spoken" sidesteps the race.
#
# Why `contains` not `==`: tool_use inputs aren't text blocks, so accidental
# quoting of the sentinel inside Bash/Edit args doesn't leak. Within a real
# spoken turn, accidental sentinel quotes are rare enough that contains is
# fine — and forgiving wording (e.g. "OK. Human asked me to stop. ...
# Stopping now.") still works.
#
# A small sleep below buffers against the writer race.
#
# Edit SENTINEL or REMINDER below to change wording. They must agree: the
# REMINDER instructs the agent to emit SENTINEL verbatim.
