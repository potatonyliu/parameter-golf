# Blocks until <experiment_dir>/run.log contains N training-step log lines, then
# prints them. Used to gate on a healthy trajectory before committing to wait
# the full ~5 minutes for a run to finish, and also to peek mid-run at any
# threshold the agent cares about (e.g. "show me steps through 100").
#
# Robustness:
#   - If the log file doesn't exist yet (script called before run_experiment.sh
#     has started writing), waits up to MAX_WAIT_SECONDS for it to appear.
#   - Exits early if the python training process dies before reaching N
#     (pgrep "train_gpt.py", case-insensitive).
#   - Exits early if the log file goes stale for >LOG_STALE_SECONDS, BUT only
#     while training is still in progress. Once the final training step
#     (step:M/M train_loss:...) has been logged, the stale-mtime check is
#     suppressed because eval_val runs as a single computation that doesn't
#     log incrementally — minutes of legitimate silence then.
#   - Hard ceiling of MAX_WAIT_SECONDS (default 1800) so the script never hangs
#     a Bash background task forever. Override if you need to wait through a
#     full-val eval (which can take >10 min on MPS), or shorten for an early
#     trajectory-gate call. The two real "stuck" signals (python gone, log
#     idle >LOG_STALE_SECONDS during training) fire well before the ceiling,
#     so a long ceiling mostly removes "had to call await twice" friction.
#
# Override defaults via env vars: MAX_WAIT_SECONDS, LOG_STALE_SECONDS.

Usage: $0 <experiment_dir> [n=10]

Blocks until <experiment_dir>/run.log contains N training-step log lines, then
prints them. Useful for gating on a healthy trajectory before committing to a
full ~5 min wait, and also for peeking mid-run at any step threshold (e.g.
n=100 to inspect through step 100).

Exits early on:
  - python process gone (pgrep "train_gpt.py")
  - log mtime stale > LOG_STALE_SECONDS (default 60) — handles hung Python.
    Suppressed once the final training step has been logged, because eval_val
    is a single long computation that doesn't log incrementally.
  - hard timeout > MAX_WAIT_SECONDS (default 1800). The two stuck-signals
    above usually fire well before this; the ceiling exists so the bash
    background task never hangs forever. Shorten for trajectory-gate calls.

Env overrides: MAX_WAIT_SECONDS, LOG_STALE_SECONDS.
